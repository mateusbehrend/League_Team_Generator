# Description

This web app, built with ReactJS, generates pairs of equivalent team formations for the League of Legends game. Each player's prospective role input is assigned an estimated raw value, which is then used to determine teams of relatively equal capabilites, whereby team equivalency is defined as a raw difference of approximately zero. The app outputs ten different pairs of team options from which players can choose their teams.
