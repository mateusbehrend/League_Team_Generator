# Description

Custom website built to construct two equivalent teams for league of legends. The final result displays 10 different team options, where the prospective roles are calculated and these calculations are used to generate a role-specific value difference and desplay these results to allow the players to accurately choose the most accurate results. Additonally, each team generation also displays a raw difference where the each player of the team has a estimated raw value that is used to compare to find an approximately equal team indicated by a raw difference that is close to 0.
