# League of Legends Team Generator

This web app, built with ReactJS, generates pairs of equivalent team formations for the game League of Legends. Each player's prospective role input is assigned an estimated raw value, which is used to form teams of relatively equal strength. The goal is to minimize the difference in raw values between the teams, with a difference close to zero indicating team equivalence. The app outputs ten different team pair options for players to choose from.
