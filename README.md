# League of Legends Team Generator

This web app, built with ReactJS, generates pairs of equivalent team formations for the League of Legends game. Each player's prospective role input is assigned an estimated raw value, which is then used to determine teams of relatively equal capabilities, with a difference in raw values close to zero serving as the criterion for team equivalence. The app outputs ten different pairs of team options from which players can choose their teams.
